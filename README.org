* BEGAN Deep learning course

 implementation of the paper: [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10717.pdf][BEGAN]]

 First generate the data by downloading the CelebA in the data folder
 and then running the face_detect script

 then run the main script to train the network
 potentially use wandb for sweeps

 finally use the generate script to generate image of the training
 process
